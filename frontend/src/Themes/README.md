### Theme Configurations

#### Overview

This folder contains theme configurations for our application, focusing on providing a consistent and customizable user interface. 

#### Files

- [**CustomThemes.jsx**](./CustomThemes.jsx): 
  This file defines custom themes for the application. It configures theme settings such as colors, typography, and other UI elements that can be applied across the application to maintain a consistent look and feel. These themes are then made available to the application through Material-UI's `ThemeProvider`, which applies the selected theme to all components within its context. 
  
  This file is designed with modularity in mind, allowing for easy customization and addition of new themes. Developers can modify existing themes or add new ones by defining additional theme configuration objects and exporting them. This modularity ensures that the application can adapt to future design requirements with minimal effort.

- [**ThemePreferences.jsx**](./ThemePreferences.jsx): This file lists and manages theme preferences for the application. It includes functionality to switch between themes based on user selection, persisting these preferences across sessions. The implementation ensures that the user's theme preference is loaded and applied every time the application is accessed.
