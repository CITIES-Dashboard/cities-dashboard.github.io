This dashboard is created by and for the community of NYU Abu Dhabi, students, researchers, faculty, staff, and NYUAD partners alike. We highly encourage anyone interested to contribute to this <b>open-source</b> project by sharing new datasets, analyzing existing datasets, proposing projects, and promoting the dashboard to a wider audience. Ultimately, we envision the CITIES Dashboard as a handy tool to support research, education, and community outreach within the NYU Abu Dhabi campus and a precious instrument to support NYUAD partners in meeting their KPI (e.g., reducing food waste).<br /><br /><b>Reach out</b> to us at <a class='iconLink' href='mailto:nyuad.cities@nyu.edu'>nyuad.cities@nyu.edu</a> to share your ideas and get involved. In the meantime, explore existing datasets with interactive data visualizations designed by CITIES' students, research fellows, and staff in collaboration with CITIES partners. Stay tuned as more datasets will be available soon.<br /><br /><b>We thank</b> Royal Catering, NYUAD Athletics, and NYUAD Institutional Reseach for supporting this project with their data.",
