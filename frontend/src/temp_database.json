It publicized, for the first time, air quality around the NYU Abu Dhabi campus to the community. Recognizing the potential of this project, and to further raise awareness and encourage sustainable behaviors within and beyond the university community, CITIES decided to scale it up by equipping the network with higher-grade sensors and transfering technology to other schools in Abu Dhabi.<br><br>The air quality network on NYU Abu Dhabi now consists of 3 stations: an outdoor station situated in between A1 and A2 building, an indoor station in the Campus Center, and another indoor station in the Dining Hall D2.
