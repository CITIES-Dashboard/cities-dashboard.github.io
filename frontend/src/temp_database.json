It publicized, for the first time, air quality around the NYU Abu Dhabi campus complex to the community. The air quality network consists of 3 stations: an outdoor station situated in between A1 and A2 building, an indoor station in the Campus Center, and another indoor station in the East Dining Hall D2. Recognizing the potential of this project to further raise awareness and encourage sustainable behaviors within and beyond the university community, CITIES has committed to support the air quality network for the past few years.",
