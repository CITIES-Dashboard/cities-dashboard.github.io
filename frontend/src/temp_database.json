However, there was a significant decrease of staff affiliated and guest memberships in AY20-21 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic when remote working policies and campus access restrictions were in place. Undergraduate students saw only a minor 14% year-by-year decrease in 2020 as most students were allowed to stay on-campus, followed by an almost two-fold increase in AY21-22",
